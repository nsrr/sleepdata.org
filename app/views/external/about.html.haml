          data exchange and analysis, and offer ideas on how to make NSRR and other
          resources work best for the scientific community.

          databases, including the MIMIC and MIMIC II Waveform and Clinical Databases
          collected from over 30,000 ICU patients, and a wide range of specialized
          data sets from clinical and research studies.

          Diseases and Resources, Transfusion Medicine and Cellular
          Therapeutics Branch, and the NHLBI Data Repository, managed by the NHLBI,

          These two programs have always had a similar mission, namely to enhance and
          facilitate further research in cardiovascular, pulmonary and hematologic
          conditions by providing access to qualified investigators to stored
          biospecimen and data collections.
