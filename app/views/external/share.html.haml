          The National Sleep Research Resource (NSRR) is an NHLBI-funded
          resource designed to host and share data from major sleep cohort
          studies and clinical trials. We welcome contributions from researchers
          in sleep medicine and related disciplines. The NSRR provides all data
          cost-free to incoming users who complete an online data request. Any
          and all data - retrospective and prospective - are welcome on the
          NSRR.

          and must adhere to the data sharing language stated in the participant
          informed consent. Records and files from participants who did not consent to
          data sharing must be redacted before submitting to the NSRR.

          The NSRR creates a unique space to share and link covariate data, complex
          physiological data, and quantitative signal (e.g. EEG, ECG) processing
          results. The NSRR team will guide you through the process of preparing and
          uploading your datasets to the NSRR.
