          The National Sleep Research Resource (NSRR; sleepdata.org) is an
          NHLBI-funded resource designed to host and share data. The National
          Sleep Research Resource offers free access to large collections of
          de-identified physiological signals and clinical data elements
          collected in well-characterized research cohorts and clinical trials.
          We welcome contributions from researchers in sleep medicine and
          related disciplines. The NSRR provides all data cost-free to incoming
          users who complete an online data request. Any and all data -
          retrospective and prospective - are welcome on the NSRR. The NSRR
          creates a unique space to share and link covariate data, complex
          physiological data, and quantitative signal (e.g. EEG, ECG) processing
          results. For an overview of the NSRR data sharing process, please

          The NSRR platform is currently housed on the Discovery Informatics
          Platform for Research provided by Research Information Science &
          Computing (RISC) at the Brigham and Womenâ€™s Hospital. The downloadable
          data on the NSRR website is housed on dedicated Research Interactive
          Storage systems. Data security is addressed at multiple levels. The
          NSRR infrastructure is encrypted using end-to-end SSL encryption, and
          the NSRR servers, database, and files are stored in the physically
          secure Mass General Brigham Research Computing data center. Access to
          the resources is controlled by per-dataset-access control, and access
          is only granted to individuals who have completed the web-based Data
          Access and Use Agreement (DAUA). Each DAUA submission is reviewed by
          the NSRR Review Committee, and reviewers ascertain that use of data
          appears appropriate with the intention of data collected and that
          there is a commitment to keep the data stored securely by the
          end-user. NSRR DAUAs expire 3 years from the date access is granted
          and can be renewed by either submitting a new request for data access
          or by requesting an extension of the agreement in writing to the NSRR
          Review Committee.
